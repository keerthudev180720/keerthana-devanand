## 🚀 About Me

I'm a data engineer with hands-on experience in designing end-to-end data pipelines, cloud architecture, and database optimization. My work spans from building serverless data platforms on AWS to implementing real-time ETL workflows using Apache technologies. With a strong foundation in both software engineering and analytics, I bridge the gap between data infrastructure and business intelligence.

**Current Role:** Database Developer Intern at NSpark Technology LLC, where I'm designing scalable relational databases and building automated ETL pipelines that improve data processing efficiency by 30%.
